# Hospital Management System

I have developed a Hospital Management System as my academic project which aims to simplify and digitize healthcare administration. This project simulates real-world hospital operations and is designed with scalability, usability, and data accuracy in mind.

## What It Does

### Admin Panel
- Secure login and self-profile management

### Doctor Management
- Register, view, update, and delete doctor profiles

### Patient Management
- Add, view, group by family, and discharge patients

### Doctor Assignment
- Assign or reassign doctors to patients with ease

### Data Handling
- Save/load all patient data to/from files for persistence

### Reports & Insights
- Generate detailed management reports including:
  - Total doctors in the system
  - Number of patients per doctor
  - Monthly appointments per doctor
  - Patient statistics by illness type

### Data Visualization
- View interactive diagrams to better understand the hospitalâ€™s performance metrics

## Why It Matters

This system not only improves hospital workflows but also enhances the decision-making process through detailed reports and visual analytics. It reflects a real-world scenario where health organizations can benefit from digital transformation.
